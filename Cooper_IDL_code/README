To run main_mpdx_fp.pro you need these folders in your idl path


Add these lines to your idlstartup.pro file which should be sourced in your .bash_profile (.bashrc probably works too).



!PATH = !PATH + ':' + Expand_Path('+/data/proc')
!PATH = !PATH + ':' + Expand_Path('+/data/procscripts')
!PATH = !PATH + ':' + Expand_Path('+/home/MPDXdata/idl')
!PATH = !PATH + ':' + Expand_Path('+/data/tatooine')
